# User Defined Content Blocks

## Introduction

User defined content blocks is a prototype content blocks module, using the approach taken by user forms. It's currently a proof of concept, and not in any state to be used in any project. It's an experiment to figure out how hard it would be to have a more upfront, easy to edit appraoch to content blocks. Code borrows heavily from user forms. https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms
